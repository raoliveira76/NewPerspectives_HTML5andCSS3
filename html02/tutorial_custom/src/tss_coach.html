                            I have been given great feedback and encouragement by the TSS coaches. This last winter I took part in the Winter Cycling
                            class and it made a huge difference to my spring rides. The coaches are caring professionals
                            and they know their business.

                    <p>Our mission at TSS is to help you reach your athletic goals through motivation, support, and education.
                        We have years of experience with athletes of all ages and abilities and we're happy to assist any
                        athlete committed to pursuing his or her dreams.
                    </p>
                    <p>We offer one-on-one coaching, evaluation, and instruction; but we also offer small group practices. Our
                        classes are never large in number. We believe that a low coach-to-athlete ratio provides the best
                        results in the shortest time.
                    </p>
                    <p>Come in and introduce yourself to our team of coaches and educators.</p>

                        <p>Alison brings an extensive background in physiology and biomechanics to TSS and 18 years of experience
                            coaching in the health and fitness field. She is a USA Triathlon Level II Certified coach and
                            is certified in strength, conditioning, and bike fitting. Before founding
                            <em>Tri and Succeed Sports</em>, Alison built a private training studio for local athletes.</p>
                        <p>Alison was a lettered volleyball player at the University of Texas and she picked up the sport of
                            triathlon after graduation. Triathlons have been her passion ever since. She has competed in
                            many short- to long-distance running, cycling, and triathlon events including multiple races
                            in IM Texas, IM Brazil, and IM Chicago.</p>
                        <p>Alison wants to provide personalized instruction to her athletes. She believes an educated athlete
                            is an athlete primed for success. Under her instruction, you will learn not only what to do but
                            why to do it.</p>

                            <ul class="o-list-checked">
                                <li class="o-list-checked__item">BS, USAT Level I</li>

                        <p>Kevin is a student of body mechanics. In addition to a Bachelor's degree in Kinesiology, Kevin brings
                            certification in Swim Instruction and coaching. He has coached numerous recreational and elite
                            athletes, including Sprint and Ironman triathletes.</p>
                        <p>In addition to coaching individual athletes, Kevin has coached a variety of teams and groups. Kevin
                            coached Swimming and Cross Country at Austin High School and Palmer Country Day School. As Head
                            Coach, his swim teams set school records in 9 out of 11 events, won the Mid-Texas Conference
                            Championship, and consistently finished in the top 3 at the Small School State meet. Kevin currently
                            coaches the Masters swim classes at TSS.</p>
                        <p>Since being talked into his first triathlon at 16, Kevin has always enjoyed the challenge the sport
                            provides. His motivation comes from the desire to improve himself, not the desire to beat others.
                            Starting as a middle of the pack athlete, his initial goal was to work his way through the distances
                            which culminated with an Ironman finish in 2010. Bill remains a student of the sport while helping
                            others achieve their fitness and racing goals.</p>

                        <p>Fitness has always been a part of Tammy's life. Whether it was running, cycling, or strength conditioning
                            she has dedicated herself to fitness and a healthy lifestyle. Trained as a mechanical designer,
                            Tammy has designed commercial strength products used in health clubs around the country. Her
                            interests led her to TSS, first as one of our athletes and then, 4 years ago, as a member of
                            the staff.</p>
                        <p>After completing her USAT certification training, Tammy designed the course of workouts we use with
                            our runners and cyclists. Tammy is also our nutritionist; she believes that reaching one's fitness
                            goals requires a holistic approach in which what goes into the body is as important as what comes
                            out.
                        </p>
                        <p>Coming from an engineering background, Tammy looks at things from an analytical point of view. Recently
                            Tammy completed two seminars on cycling with power meters. Tammy believes in continuing education
                            and has set her sights on receiving her USAT Level II certification and USAT youth coaching certification.</p>
